MOBAT - Module-based Application Template

MOBAT is a Titanium Application Template designed to make coding in Titanium less like web-based 
coding and more like traditional object oriented desktop coding.

The idea is to have all code separated into modules, while intantiating them in a single Javascript context.

This project was initiated after many Titanium courses offered in Puerto Rico (http://facebook.com/intelica) and 
many hours of Titanium Hacking for TainoApp (http://gettainoapp.com)

The code is released as Open Source under the GPL3 license.

Hope you find it useful and you can help make the code better.
